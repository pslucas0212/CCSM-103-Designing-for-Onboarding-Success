## What is Onboarding?
- What is onboarding and when is it deemed complete
- Not complet with tethe setup or configuration of a customer account.
- Not complete when converting from a free trial to a paid. Or pay in an invoice.  Goal is not to pay you.
- Not complete when regularly using product
- Some might say onboarding is never complete, but has different phases.  THink about adopting a product or service with many features and capabilites that take time to adpotp and use
- for this discussion we will say that onboarding is when the customer is setup, trained and using the product to deliver business value.  THe customer came to you to acheive business value.
- Onboarding not complete until the customer achieves business value aka as "First Value"  Or see clear path to first value with complex products or services


## Why is Onboarding So Important
- Onboarding a point of massive leverage.  If you get it right you set your customer for long term success with your product and company
- If you get it wrong, you are likely to lose that customer before the 1st renewal.  You've likely lost money on that customer since it takes approximately a year for you to breakeven
- Effective onboarding is hard and many cases of churn can be attributed to failure on in the onboarding phase
### Why is onboarding hard (risks)
1. Shift in 'ownership' of customer (finding customers) - presales vs postsales (delivering value - customer success, support, services).  Onboarding happens at this point between pre and post sales.
2. Disparate technology systems between sales and post-sales.  Information gets siloed.  Systems don't communicate well and customer information doesn't flow well between the two systems
3. Change in communication cadence.  This change can be very abrupt.  This creates some risk
4. Buyer's remorese.  Buyer wonders if they did the right thing.  Lot's of risk on the customer's shoulder.  Maybe look for ways to get out of the contract.

- Biggest positive customer impact on success can be found by focusing on the onboarding stage of the customer journey

## Key Goals of Onboarding
- Most critical part of the customers journey
1. Understand customer needs.  Fully understand what the outcomes the customer is trying to achieve with your product.  Hopefully derived from sales process and you can validate their needs during onboarding.  Validate during signup - surveys, in-app questionaires, etc.  Fill in missing gaps or validate the information you have.  This will determine the diretion to "send" the customer on.  Wrong path, you will get churn
2. Agree on a common definition of success.  Define when success is acheived during the onboarding phase.  With the is information you can set milestones during their journey.  It could be when they achieve first value.  Both parties need to agree upon
3. Educate and motivate end ussers. Success correlated directly to understanding what they need to  do and they do it.  Both need to work at this together.
4. Manage change effectively.  Existing processes need to change with the adoption of your product.  Change is not as easy as you think.  Changing habits or existing processes are hard.  The outcomes/benefits may always be apparent to the end user with the new product.  How are going to break existing habits and reform new habits.
5. Reinforce value promise by delivering compelling initial value.  Show that value promise is there and you are good to your word.  You can deliver on the promise you made.

## Key Elements of a Successful Onboarding
- A well planned onboarding process will show up as improved retentiion, upsell and customer retention
1. A robust handoff and transfer of knowledge from sales to onboarding team.  Create a robust transfer process.  Focous on this first
2. Having a customer journey that is well understood internall and is in a format that can be shared with customers.  Onboarding is a crtical part of the customer journey, but just one phase.  Need to understand how onobarding fits into the customer journey.
3. An onboarding playbook that is specific to the customers' profile and needs.  Need to understand who does what when.  What's the process and have it communiated to the customer.   Have customer profile and future needs as part of the playbook repository.
4. Clear metrics that track progress and trigger corrective action if needed.  Need to track playbook activities and identify and correct any issues early as possible.  Track impact on customer
5. A reliable process for communicating progress and demonstrating value acheived to the customer.  Show progress that you and the customer is making via project plan or an app.  Call out any value that the customer has acheived.  Demonstrate and tell about the value they acheive during every part of the journey

There are different models for onboarding new customers.
1. Self-guided/tech touch approach.  Large volumes of customers with low price.  Needs to be technology driven without much interaction from individual on your team.
2. Guided implementation.  Have a project, with processes, meetings and calls.  A team based approach with you and the customer. Maybe onboarding team or customer success team depending on your organization.  This a one-on-one approach
3. Hybrid - combination of guided and self-guide.
